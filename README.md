# Debian Bookworm for BTT Pi1.2 / CB1 - CLI BUILD - AllWinner H616

## are you looking for ready for use Images ?

* [go to Reales](https://github.com/PCV-dev/BTT-Pi1.2-CB1-Bookworm-Images-and-ImageCompiler/releases/new)


It's done. The build tool is now working. It can build CLI_Standard and CLI_Minimal images. Kernel and Bootloader individually also work. Please use it to build your own images. Please note that you should already know what you're doing. Toolchains are not all the same. And a kernel needs to be configured first. Support requests like "I tried something and it doesn't work" will not be answered.
